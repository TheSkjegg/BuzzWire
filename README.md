# BuzzWire
This repo holds the code, wiring and PCB files to build a Arduino Buzz wire game with timer and highscore as shown in this video: https://youtu.be/0P0GF0H_dCA?si=xbg_11h1RosW1U28

**Note:**
The code relies on following library's:  
u8g2 (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/u8g2/)  Big thanks to Oli Kraus for developing and sharing this library!  
LedControl (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ledcontrol/)  
EEPROM (https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/eeprom/)
